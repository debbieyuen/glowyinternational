Extended Reality (XR) represents the next evolution in human-computer interaction, merging the physical and digital worlds through immersive technologies. As an umbrella term, XR encompasses Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR)â€”each offering unique ways to experience and interact with digital content. Whether fully transporting users into virtual environments, enhancing real-world surroundings with holographic overlays, or blending both for interactive hybrid experiences, XR is reshaping how we learn, work, play, and connect.
