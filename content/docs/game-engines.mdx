Before game engines existed, games were created in assembly language. There wasn't a unified code base, making it extremely difficult to reuse code. It was until later on around 1985 where reusing code became more accessible. The Super Mario Bros was one of the first console games to be made by reusing code. 

Game engines in short is a software development program that hosts an environment for designers and developers alike to develop video games. Today, game engines can be used for much more. Some non-game applications include animatin, UI/UX design, digial art, math visualizations, machine learning training environments, cinematography, and many more! An early game engine from 1985 was [Garry's Kitchen GameMaker]().
