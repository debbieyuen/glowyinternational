## Build App
In your Unity Editor, navigate to **File/ Build Settings**. Since I am on a Mac, I will be building to **iOS**. Make sure you have selected all the scenes you want to include in your build. Then, hit **Build and Run**. If you are on a Windows, you can build to **Android**.

I recommend connecting your laptop and phone with a cable. Make sure the cords are connected while you build your app. 

All applications that are built for iOS will need to go through **XCode**. If you don't have XCode, you can download it from the Apple App Store. This is a heavy application, so if it takes up too much space and time, that is okay. If possible, please work with a student who has XCode. If you are unable to build your app with XCode, please use download [Unity Remote](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unity-remote-5/id871767552) on your phone. 

Save your build under a `builds` folder and name it as something like `version1.0`.

After saving your build, you should be able to open the project in XCode. If you clicked on **Build and Run**, XCode should open automaticaly. If you are on Android Studio or XCode and need a paid developer account, please reach out to Debbie - she has her personal credentials that you can use. 

## Preview on Phone

    Connect your phone to your laptop. Spend some time playing around with the AR application.

    If you are using **Unity Preview**, you are required to connect with a USB. Go to `Edit / Project Settings / Editor` and select your phone. 

## The Unity Console

    After you connect your phone to Unity, you should see lines printed out within your Unity Console. They should show data from your phone's gyroscope.
