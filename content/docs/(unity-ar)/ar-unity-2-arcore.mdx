Now we will explore how we can create XR applications with code in [Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/XR.html)! 

For **Mac** users, you can only build to iOS devices such as the Apple Vision Pro, iPhone, iPad, Mac. Users on a **Windows** machine can only build to Android devices. If you do not have compatible hardware, please work together with other students in the class on this homework assignment. **On Brightspace, please leave a comment noting who you collaborated with on this homework assignment.**

We can also use [Unity Remote](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityRemote5.html) to build our AR applications. Unity Remote is a downloadable application that helps with Android, iOS, and tvOS development. Unity Remote connects your target device to the Unity Editor and displays the visual output from the Editor on the target deviceâ€™s screen at a reduced frame rate. It also sends live inputs from the target device back to the running project in Unity. This is useful to understand how an application looks and handles on the target device without creating a build. In order to use Unity Remote, we will need to download it on your personal phones.

## Install Unity AR Template

Install the Unity AR or MR Core templates. Feel free to pick whichever template you find more interesting. Depending on which Unity version you are on, the name and content of the template may vary. Download the templates and explore what transforms a 3D scene into one that is compatible with AR, VR, or MR. 

    1. Install a Unity AR or MR template of your choice. Here, I installed the [Unity AR Core template](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/xr-template-ar.html) from Unity Hub. 
    2. **Explore the Contents**: Explore the **Scene** and **Game** tabs. Investigate the `prefab` **XR Origin**. What does it do?
