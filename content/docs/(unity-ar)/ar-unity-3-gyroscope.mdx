## Gyroscope

Create a new script in Unity named `Gyroscope.cs`. Attach your script to a cube or 3D object that is in your scene. It is important to attach your Unity script after you create it. It will throw errors if you have a script that is not attached. 
    
 Then, copy and paste the following code into your `Gyroscope.cs` script. The code will also be found in the following repository [`https://github.com/debbieyuen/ctin583-fa24-hw/`](https://github.com/debbieyuen/ctin583-fa24-hw/). To access this code on your own fork, click on the sync changes button on your forked repository.

    ``` c# title="Gyroscope.cs" linenums="1"
    using System.Collections;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using UnityEngine;

    public class Gyroscope : MonoBehaviour
    {

        // Start is called before the first frame update
        void Start()
        {
            Input.gyro.enabled = true;
        }

        // Update is called once per frame
        void Update()
        {
            Debug.Log(Input.gyro.attitude);
            transform.rotation = Input.gyro.attitude;
        }
    }
    ```

{/* ???+ question "Step 4: Build App"

    In your Unity Editor, navigate to **File/ Build Settings**. Since I am on a Mac, I will be building to **iOS**. Make sure you have selected all the scenes you want to include in your build. Then, hit **Build and Run**. If you are on a Windows, you can build to **Android**.

    I recommend connecting your laptop and phone with a cable. Make sure the cords are connected while you build your app. 

    All applications that are built for iOS will need to go through **XCode**. If you don't have XCode, you can download it from the Apple App Store. This is a heavy application, so if it takes up too much space and time, that is okay. If possible, please work with a student who has XCode. If you are unable to build your app with XCode, please use download [Unity Remote](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unity-remote-5/id871767552) on your phone. 

    Save your build under a `builds` folder and name it as something like `version1.0`.

    After saving your build, you should be able to open the project in XCode. If you clicked on **Build and Run**, XCode should open automaticaly. 

    If you are on Android Studio or XCode and need a paid developer account, please reach out to Debbie - she has her personal credentials that you can use. 

???+ question "Step 5: Preview on Phone"

    Connect your phone to your laptop. Spend some time playing around with the AR application.

    If you are using **Unity Preview**, you are required to connect with a USB. Go to **Edit / Project Settings / Editor** and select your phone. 

???+ question "Step 6: Unity Console"

    After you connect your phone to Unity, you should see lines printed out within your Unity Console. They should show data from your phone's gyroscope. */}
