Virtual reality is a simulated 3D environment that enables users to explore and interact with a virtual surrounding in a way that approximates reality, as it is perceived through the users' senses. The environment is created with computer hardware and software, although users might also need to wear devices such as helmets or goggles to interact with the environment. The more deeply users can immerse themselves in a VR environment -- and block out their physical surroundings -- the more they are able to suspend their belief and accept it as real, even if it is fantastical in nature.

Some main types:

* Non-immersive. This type of VR typically refers to a 3D simulated environment that's accessed through a computer screen. The environment might also generate sound, depending on the program. The user has some control over the virtual environment using a keyboard, mouse or other device, but the environment does not directly interact with the user. A video game is a good example of non-immersive VR, as is a website that enables a user to design a room's decor.

* Semi-immersive. This type of VR offers a partial virtual experience that's accessed through a computer screen or some type of glasses or headset. It focuses primarily on the visual 3D aspect of virtual reality and does not incorporate physical movement in the way that full immersion does. A common example of semi-immersive VR is the flight simulator, which is used by airlines and militaries to train their pilots.

* Fully immersive. This type of VR delivers the greatest level of virtual reality, completely immersing the user in the simulated 3D world. It incorporates sight, sound and, in some cases, touch. There have even been some experiments with the addition of smell. Users wear special equipment such as helmets, goggles or gloves and are able to fully interact with the environment. The environment might also incorporate such equipment as treadmills or stationary bicycles to provide users with the experience of moving through the 3D space. Fully immersive VR technology is a field still in its infancy, but it has made important inroads into the gaming industry and to some extent the healthcare industry, and it's generating a great deal of interest in others.

### VR Core with Meta Developer

???+ question "Step 1: Meta Quest Developer"
    Create an account with [Meta Quest Developer](https://developer.oculus.com/). For convenience, my account is associated with my Facebook and Instagram accounts. Creating an account with Meta Developer will allow you to build and launch your VR applications on the Oculus Quest headsets. On the USC headsets, I am unsure if a developer account is associated with them already. If they are not, you will need to sign in with your own credentials. After you are done with your VR headset, remember to sign out of your account! 

???+ question "Step 2: Enable Developer Mode on Oculus Quest"
    Write in the comments what each line of `using` is doing. What are these packages in Unity?

???+ question "Step 3: Create VR App with Unity"
    Create a new VR project with the VR Core. Explore its contents!

???+ question "Step 4: Build App to the Oculus Quest"
    Build your application as an **Android** build. Select your Oculus Quest when connected to your computer. 
    If you are on a **Mac**, you must build to a headset. If you are on **Windows**, Unity has the [Meta Quest Quick Link App](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-rift-s/install-app-for-link/). [Here](https://www.circuitstream.com/blog/how-to-setup-oculus-quest-2-for-development-in-unity-under-20-minutes) are some instructions.
