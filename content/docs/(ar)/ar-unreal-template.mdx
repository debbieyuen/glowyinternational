description: Developing an AR mobile application for iOS/Android with Unreal Engine 5
---

Let's start creating a marker app with Unreal Engine! By the end of this section, you will have an AR application that detects markers and displays a 3D model. This guide supports both iOS and Android build processes.

## 1. Setting Up
We will be creating our application with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). Any version of UE5 should work. If you don't have UE5, please download the [**Epics Games Launcher**](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download), create an Epic Games account, and then install a version of Unreal Engine. For **Mac** users, you can only build to iOS devices such as the Apple Vision Pro, iPhone, iPad, Mac. Users on a **Windows** machine can only build to Android devices. If you do not have compatible hardware, please work together with other students in the class on this homework assignment. Please note the required hardware and materials below: 
  1. A cord that connects from your computer to your phone
  2. If you are working on a Windows, you will need to work with an Android phone
  3. If you are working on a Mac, you will need to work with an iPhone/iPad

## 2. New Project with Template
In your `Unreal Project Browser`, navigate to the `Games` tab. Next, create a new project with the [`Handheld AR`](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/handheld-ar-template-quickstart-in-unreal-engine) template.

## 3. Project Files and Documentation
Once you have your project open, there are a couple of important files that you will need in order to make your AR Marker application. 
  1. **AR Session Config**
  2. **AR Session Config**

    Find guides, references, and the documentation at [Unreal Engine Developer Documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/augmented-reality-development?application_version=4.27).

## 4. The Outliner Windows
In the **Outliner** window, delete everything except for the `DirectionalLight` and `SkyLight`. Next, create a new **Actor** at `(0, 0, 0)` and name it **TrackedParent**.
Within **TrackedParent**, place your 3D model or begin with a 3D cube by adding `Shapes/Cube`.
