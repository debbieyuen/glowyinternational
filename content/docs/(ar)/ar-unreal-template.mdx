description: Developing an AR mobile application for iOS/Android with Unreal Engine 5
---

Let's start creating a marker app with Unreal Engine! By the end of this section, you will have an AR application that detects markers and displays a 3D model. This guide supports both iOS and Android build processes.

## 1. Setting Up
We will be creating our application with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). Any version of UE5 should work. If you don't have UE5, please download the **Epics Games Launcher**, create an Epic Games account, and then install a version of Unreal Engine. Please note the required hardware and materials below: 
  1. A cord that connects from your computer to your phone
  2. If you are working on a Windows, you will need to work with an Android phone
  3. If you are working on a Mac, you will need to work with an iPhone/iPad

## 2. New Project with Template
In your `Unreal Project Browser`, navigate to the `Games` tab. Next, create a new project with the [`Handheld AR`](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/handheld-ar-template-quickstart-in-unreal-engine) template. 

## 3. Project Files
Once you have your project open, there are a couple of important files that you will need in order to make your AR Marker application. 
  1. **AR Session Config**
  2. **AR Session Config** 

## 4. The Outliner Windows
In the **Outliner** window, delete everything except for the `DirectionalLight` and `SkyLight`. Next, create a new **Actor** at `(0, 0, 0)` and name it **TrackedParent**.
Within **TrackedParent**, place your 3D model or begin with a 3D cube by adding `Shapes/Cube`.
