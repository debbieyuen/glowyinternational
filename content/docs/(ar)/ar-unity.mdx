Now we will explore how we can create XR applications with code in [Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/XR.html)! 

For **Mac** users, you can only build to iOS devices such as the Apple Vision Pro, iPhone, iPad, Mac. Users on a **Windows** machine can only build to Android devices. If you do not have compatible hardware, please work together with other students in the class on this homework assignment. **On Brightspace, please leave a comment noting who you collaborated with on this homework assignment.**

We can also use [Unity Remote](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityRemote5.html) to build our AR applications. Unity Remote is a downloadable application that helps with Android, iOS, and tvOS development. Unity Remote connects your target device to the Unity Editor and displays the visual output from the Editor on the target deviceâ€™s screen at a reduced frame rate. It also sends live inputs from the target device back to the running project in Unity. This is useful to understand how an application looks and handles on the target device without creating a build. In order to use Unity Remote, we will need to download it on your personal phones.

### Problem 1: AR/MR Core

Install the Unity AR or MR Core templates. Feel free to pick whichever template you find more interesting. Depending on which Unity version you are on, the name and content of the template may vary. Download the templates and explore what transforms a 3D scene into one that is compatible with AR, VR, or MR. 

For this homework assignment, the screenshots are created with the Unity **AR Mobile Core** template (2022.3.7f1) on Debbie's **MacBook Pro** for her **iPhone 12 Pro**. These steps may be slightly different on other computers and hardware.

???+ question "Step 1: Install Unity AR Template"

    Install a Unity AR or MR template of your choice. Here, I installed the [Unity AR Core template](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/xr-template-ar.html) from Unity Hub. 


???+ question "Step 2: Explore the Contents"

    Explore the **Scene** and **Game** tabs. Investigate the `prefab` **XR Origin**. What does it do? 

???+ question "Step 3: Gyroscope"

    Create a new script in Unity named `Gyroscope.cs`. Attach your script to a cube or 3D object that is in your scene. It is important to attach your Unity script after you create it. It will throw errors if you have a script that is not attached. 
    
    Then, copy and paste the following code into your `Gyroscope.cs` script. The code will also be found in the following repository [`https://github.com/debbieyuen/ctin583-fa24-hw/`](https://github.com/debbieyuen/ctin583-fa24-hw/). To access this code on your own fork, click on the sync changes button on your forked repository.

    ``` c# title="Gyroscope.cs" linenums="1"
    using System.Collections;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using UnityEngine;

    public class Gyroscope : MonoBehaviour
    {

        // Start is called before the first frame update
        void Start()
        {
            Input.gyro.enabled = true;
        }

        // Update is called once per frame
        void Update()
        {
            Debug.Log(Input.gyro.attitude);
            transform.rotation = Input.gyro.attitude;
        }
    }
    ```

{/* ???+ question "Step 4: Build App"

    In your Unity Editor, navigate to **File/ Build Settings**. Since I am on a Mac, I will be building to **iOS**. Make sure you have selected all the scenes you want to include in your build. Then, hit **Build and Run**. If you are on a Windows, you can build to **Android**.

    I recommend connecting your laptop and phone with a cable. Make sure the cords are connected while you build your app. 

    All applications that are built for iOS will need to go through **XCode**. If you don't have XCode, you can download it from the Apple App Store. This is a heavy application, so if it takes up too much space and time, that is okay. If possible, please work with a student who has XCode. If you are unable to build your app with XCode, please use download [Unity Remote](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unity-remote-5/id871767552) on your phone. 

    Save your build under a `builds` folder and name it as something like `version1.0`.

    After saving your build, you should be able to open the project in XCode. If you clicked on **Build and Run**, XCode should open automaticaly. 

    If you are on Android Studio or XCode and need a paid developer account, please reach out to Debbie - she has her personal credentials that you can use. 

???+ question "Step 5: Preview on Phone"

    Connect your phone to your laptop. Spend some time playing around with the AR application.

    If you are using **Unity Preview**, you are required to connect with a USB. Go to **Edit / Project Settings / Editor** and select your phone. 

???+ question "Step 6: Unity Console"

    After you connect your phone to Unity, you should see lines printed out within your Unity Console. They should show data from your phone's gyroscope. */}
