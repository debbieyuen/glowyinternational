## 8. Creating AR Game Mode
In Unreal Engine, you typically use a custom AR_GameMode when building AR applications for Android and iOS to set up the core rules, behavior, and environment needed for augmented reality experiences. Like other Game Modes, our `AR_GameMode` defines the rules and flow of the experience or game. This may include defining who the player is, what happens when the game starts, and what actors get spawned. This is especially important when spawning AR sessions and trackable objects. 

As we continue to develop this AR application in the future, the `AR_GameMode` can help us with the AR session lifecycle such as starting, pausing, and stopping. In addition to showing and displaying UI, notifications, 3D models, animations, and much more.

With Unreal's default AR template, you should find a `BP_ARGameMode` defined for you. If you do not have one, in your **Content Drawer**, right click and create new `Blueprint Class / Game Mode Base`. Then, name your Blueprint **BP_ARGameMode**. Finally, make sure that in the **Details** panel, the `Default Pawn Class` is set to your AR Pawn, which in our case would be `BP_ARPawn`.

## 9. Cross-Platform Handling
Because we are designing for a mobile device, the scene will need to be preared for **ARKit (iOS)** or **ARCore (Android)** input. Since ARKit and ARCore have and are different APIs, Unreal Engine abstracts that with the **ARSessionConfig** and AR-specific actors/components.

Our `AR_GameMode` is helpful here in handling platform-specific beavior, configuring the `ARSession`, and bringing a consistent experience across platforms.

Now we need to make sure we have all the settings configured correctly.
    1. `Edit/ Project Settings / Map & Modes` then navigate to the `Default Maps` tab and find **Game Default Map** where `APK Packaging: Orientation` should be `Sensor Portrait` or `Portrait`.
    2. **If building to Android:** `Edit/ Project Settings / Platforms - Android` and uncheck `Support Vulkan`
    3. **If building to iOS:** `Edit/ Project Settings / Platforms - iOS / XCode Projects` keep `Modern XCode` enabled by checking `Modernized Xcode`. Then, input your **Apple Dev Account Team ID**. Navigate to the `iOS` tab and input a `Bundle Display Name` and `Bundle Name` and check `Supports Portrait Orientation`.
