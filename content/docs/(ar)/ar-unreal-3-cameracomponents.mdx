Now that we have our scene setup, we want to create some files and import our images that we will be using as markers. 

## 6. ARPawn Camera Component
If you started with the AR template provided by Unreal, your **Content Drawer** should have a `BP_ARPawn` created for you. If you do not have one you may create an ARPawn by navigating to your **Content Drawer** and right clicking to `Create Blueprint Class / Pawn / ARPawn`. 

Once we have an **ARPawn**, we want to open it and make sure we have a camera component. If you do not have a camera, we may add a `Camera` as a component at `(0, 0, 0)` then hit the `Compile` and `Save` buttons at the top left hand corner.

## 7. ARPawn Blueprinting

In your `BP_ARPawn` Blueprint, scroll up to he `Event BeginPlay` node and remove the connection linked. Remember to hit `Compile` and `Save`.
