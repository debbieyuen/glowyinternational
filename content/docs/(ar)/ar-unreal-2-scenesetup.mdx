description: Developing an AR mobile application for iOS/Android with Unreal Engine 5
---

Let's start creating a marker app with Unreal Engine! By the end of this section, you will have an AR application that detects markers and displays a 3D model. This guide supports both iOS and Android build processes.

## 1. Setting Up
We will be creating our application with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). Any version of UE5 should work. If you don't have UE5, please download the [**Epics Games Launcher**](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download), create an Epic Games account, and then install a version of Unreal Engine. For **Mac** users, you can only build to iOS devices such as the Apple Vision Pro, iPhone, iPad, Mac. Users on a **Windows** machine can only build to Android devices. If you do not have compatible hardware, please work together with other students in the class on this homework assignment. Please note the required hardware and materials below: 
  1. A cord that connects from your computer to your phone
  2. If you are working on a Windows, you will need to work with an Android phone
  3. If you are working on a Mac, you will need to work with an iPhone/iPad

## 2. New Project with Template
In your `Unreal Project Browser`, navigate to the `Games` tab. Next, create a new project with the [`Handheld AR`](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/handheld-ar-template-quickstart-in-unreal-engine) template. 

If you would like to start completely from scratch with an empty project or with an existing project you have worked on before, create a project that supports Blueprints and the `Target Platform` set as `Mobile`. With your new project, you should have a main level that would hold the contents of our scene.

## 3. Project Files and Documentation
Once you have your project open, there are a couple of important files that you will need in order to make your AR Marker application. 
  1. `D_ARSessionConfig`: The [**AR Session Config**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/python-api/class/ARSessionConfig?application_version=5.4) defines the features used in the AR session such as the images used and the video quality. With Unreal's AR Template, the AR Session Config can be found under the `HandheldAR` folder.
  2. `BP_ARGameMode`: The [**Game Mode Base**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/game-mode-and-game-state-in-unreal-engine) defines the game being played, its rules, scoring, and other facets of the game type.
  3. `BP_ARPawn`: A [**Pawn**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/pawn-in-unreal-engine) is an actor that can be 'possessed' and receive input from a controller. This Pawn is responsible for initialization, building and updating the virtual scene, and handling the user's input.
  4. `BP_ARPlayerController`:

## 4. Scene Setup in the Outliner
In the **Outliner** window, delete everything except for the `DirectionalLight` and `SkyLight`. Next, create a new empty **Basic/ Actor** object at `(0, 0, 0)` and name it **TrackedParent**.
Within **TrackedParent**, begin with a 3D cube by adding `Shapes/ Cube` also at `(0, 0, 5)`.  In order for the 3D cube to be nested within **TrackedParent**, it must be set to `Movable` in Mobility.

Finally, we will adjust the 3D cube's scale to `(0.1, 0.1, 0.1)`. If you have your own 3D model, you may bring it in here and scale it to be around the 3D cube's size.

## 5. 3D Models and Materials
To make sure we are able to see our 3D cube, we will need to add a material. In your **Content Drawer**, create a new **Material** and name it **Unlit Cube Material**. Next, attach it to the 3D cube by dragging the material onto it. Once it is attached, open up the new material you created to link up the material specs and ensure that the `Shading Model` is set as `Unlit`.
