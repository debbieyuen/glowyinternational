Now, we will need to set up our ARSession Config to track and detect our 2D images and markers.


## 11. Creating Marker Images
Creating an AR marker app for a card game, for example, can help in bringing static cards to life. We can add dynamic 3D animations, sound effects, and other interactive elements by overlaying visual cues or user interfaces directly onto the cards. We can even save the cards into a book or collection. This fusion of physical cards and digital effects can add an additional layer to the experience, allowing players to do more beyond the c ard's surface and into a shared augmented space. By enabling multiplayer or remote play through AR scenes between players, we can change how card games are experienced with and without physical cards. Ultimately, AR marker applications can open up the possibilities for hybrid and digital experiences. 

### Designing Cards in Unreal
Designing a card template in Unreal Engine means we will be building a reusable Blueprint or UI layout that can represent cards in our game. This may invovle physical (scanned via AR marker) or digital (displayed on mobile screen). 

**Here are some resources on how to get started:**

### Designing with 2D Design Software

We may design our cards using a variety of design tools outside of Unreal Engine.

## 12. Importing Marker Images
Once you have your marker images, make sure you have the following: 
    * Dimensions of your cards in *cm*
    * Cards and markers are created in `RGBA` 
    * Exported as *.png* or *.jpg* or similar format 

In your **Content Drawer**, create a new folder for your marker images. Right click and select `Import to` and select your images. Your images will import as `Textures`.

Start with clicking on one of the `Textures` you just imported. In the **Details** panel, set the following: 
    1. Navigate to `Compression / Compression Settings` and then set it to `UserInterface2D (RGBA)`
    2. Navigate to `Texture` where `sRGB should be checked `True`
    3. Navigate to `Level of Detail / Texture Group`: Change the dropdown selection to `UI`

Do the same for each `Texture` you imported.

## 13. Configuring Marker Images
    1. **Creating CandidateImages:** In your **Content Drawer**, navigate to `Miscellaneous / Data Asset / AR Candidate Image`. Name your **Candidate Image** to something like `[Image Title]_CandidateImage`.
    2. **Candidate Image Specs:** Open up the **CandidateImage** you created. Give it a `Friendly Name`, `Candidate Texture`: An image you uploaded, `Width and Height`: Should be in *cm*.

## 14. Configure AR Session Config

Now that we have our marker images set up, we will link our images to our `D_ARSessionConfig`. Open up your AR Session Config where under the **Details** panel, add all of your Candidate Images.
