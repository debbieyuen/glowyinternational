## Light Sources

Standard Abstract Light Types:

    * **Point Light:** Also known as *omni lights* or *spherical*, they represent light that emanates from a single point outward in all directions. A point light has a position and color, which controls the hue and intensity of the light.
    * **Spot Light:** Represents light from a specific location in a specific direction. These are commonly used for lights such as flashlights, headlights, and spot lights. A spot light has a position and an orientation, and optionally a falloff distance. The shape of the lit area is either a cone or a pyramid. 
    *  **Conical Spot Light:** The conical spot light is shaped like a cone, meaning it h as a circular bottom. The width of the cone is known as the *falloff angle*. 
    * **Rectangular Spot Light:** A rectangular spot light is similar to the conical spot light except that it forms a pyramid bottom instead of a cone shaped bottom.
    * **Directional Light:** This light represents light coming out from a point in a far away space in which all the rays of light can be considered parallel. Good examples of directional lights would be the sun and moon.
