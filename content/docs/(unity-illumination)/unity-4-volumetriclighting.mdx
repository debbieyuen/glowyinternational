We will be experimenting with Unity's **Adaptive Probe Volumes (APV)** as part of Unity 6. Please follow the steps below.

## Volumetric Lighting

    1. Step 1: Create HDRP Project: Create a new Unity HDRP project such as starting with the **High Definition 3D Sample** template in Unity.

    2. Step 2: HDRP Tutorial: Step through the **High Definition Render Pipeline** tutorials.

    3. Step 3: Clear Baked Lighting Data: Unbake all Lighting data. This way we can start with a base scene and recreate our own lighting.

    4. Step 4: Create a new Volume
    Unity's volume system is the main way to control the visual settings per camera in HDRP. Multiple volumes may share the same profile. We are able to adjust the size of the volume, contrast, saturation, and much more. When the camera enters the volume, the settings then are applied to the frame. 

    First, lets create a new volume

    5. Step 5: Create a new Profile
    Then, create a new profile

    6. Step 6: Add Override
    Then, `Add Override` and `Color Adjustments`

    {/* ![Image title](../Homework/hw12/problemOne/p1_6_override.png) */}

    7. Step 7: Experiment!
    Apply your overrides to your frame and try moving in and out of your volume. Try setting your Mode to `Global` or `Local`.
    We can adjust many things including the sky and post processing.

    8. Step 8: Disable the Fog
    Now lets try to set up the sky for HDRI with the volume system. This is done with a visual override. If we deselect the `Fog`, we can see that the HDRI unobstructed.

    9. Step 9: Visual Environment
    In your `Hierarchy` window, you may go to `Lighting` > `Volumes` > `Volume Global`. Then, in your `Inspector`, you will see `Visual Environment`. There, you can choose between four types of skies including: non-HDRI sky, HDRI Sky, Physically Based Sky, and Gradient Sky.

    10. Step 10: Sky Exposure Values
    Remember to make sure all your baked data is cleared so that we can see that in the absence, of proper indirect lighting, HDRP will always fall back to the sky probe. Now you can try adjusting the exposure values.

    11. Step 11: Sun Light
    What if we would like to have bounce lighting? HDRP is physically based, so we can control the color temperature of the light using the Kelvin scale.  In your `Hierarchy` window, you may go to `Lighting` > `Directional Light Sun`. Then in your `Inspector` window, we can find the `Light` component and then the `Emission` tab. We can try using the **Day Light** preset. Now try experimenting with the **Shadows** override components and the **Indirect Lighting Controller** component. Adjusting the Indirect Lighting Controller values can be a quick way to dim unwanted ambient lighting without using Unity Global Illumination.
